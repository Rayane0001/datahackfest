## 🎯 What is it?

Upload your CSV dataset and watch machine learning algorithms battle Pokemon-style! Each algorithm trains **for real** using scikit-learn in your browser, then fights based on authentic performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

🌳 **Random Forest** vs 🧠 **Neural Network** - who wins on YOUR data?

## 📊 Performance Metrics

Combat stats are calculated from **real ML performance:**

- **Attack** = Precision × 100
- **Defense** = Recall × 100
- **Speed** = 100 - (Training Time × 10)
- **Health** = Accuracy × 100 + Base Robustness
- **Critical Hit Rate** = F1-Score
